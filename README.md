# National Parks Database

A React App created using react-router and a third-party API that I created for a General Assembly (GA) lab. This website lists all of the National Parks using a [mockup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJS8ysB1N9Kp89_V_loagQiFNU_4jZoN/view?usp=sharing) provided by GA.

##### NOTE: The official National Parks API can be quite unreliable in terms of load-time and fetching data succesfully.

### Part I: [React Router](part-i.md)

I started by building out the app using React, React Router, and static data provided by General Assembly in [`src/data/parks.json`](./src/data/parks.json).

### Part II: [Added APIs](part-ii.md)

Once I had the site working with static data, I implemented the [National Parks API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm) to replace the static data.

### Part III [Stylize Page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJS8ysB1N9Kp89_V_loagQiFNU_4jZoN/view?usp=sharing)

Once my data and pages were in place, I made the site look like the design mockup provided.
